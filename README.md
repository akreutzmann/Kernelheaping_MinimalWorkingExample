# Kernelheaping_MinimalWorkingExample
The minimal working example shows how the R package [Kernelheaping](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Kernelheaping/Kernelheaping.pdf) (Gro√ü 2019) can be used to switch between different non-hierarchical administrative areas via simulated geo-coordinates.

The RBS files contain the shape of the two administrative areas, here the ZIP code area and the LOR level. The data file dataZIP.csv 
provides the student population on the ZIP code area level (please note that this is no real data, so no conclusions can be drawn). 
The markdown file (.rmd) shows the application step by step using the shape file and the provided data.
