# Kernelheaping_MinimalWorkingExample
The minimal working example shows how the R package [Kernelheaping](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Kernelheaping/Kernelheaping.pdf) (Gro√ü 2019) can be used to switch between different non-hierarchical administrative areas via simulated geo-coordinates.

## Provided files
* Shape files for two non-hierarchical administrative ares (ZIP code area and LOR level)
* Data on student population on the ZIP code area level (please note that this is no real data, so no conclusions can be drawn)
* Markdown file (.rmd) that shows the application step by step using the shape files and the provided data
